Below is a **ready-to-paste, impact-first Markdown block**—ordered **present → oldest**—that Cursor can turn straight into cards.
Use one blank line between cards for clean parsing.

### Layout rules Cursor can infer

1. **Header (`###`)** → project title.
2. **Meta line** (`City · Mon YYYY`) under the header.
3. **Bold one-sentence headline** on the next line.
4. **Small description** paragraph.
5. Optional external link on its own line.
6. `---` separates cards.

This keeps each card uniform, impact-centric, and concise for Cursor to render.
